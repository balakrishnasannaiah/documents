Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for Docker containers that is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.




- What is a container and Docker?
Docker container is an open source software development platform. Its main benefit is to package applications in “containers,” allowing them to be portable among any system running the Linux operating system (OS).



- What is a swarm in Docker?
Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system




- What is Kubernetes for?
What does Kubernetes actually do and why use it? Kubernetes is a vendor-agnostic cluster and container management tool, 
open-sourced by Google in 2014. 
It provides a “platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts





- What is a pod in Kubernetes?
A Kubernetes pod is a group of containers that are deployed together on the same host. If you frequently deploy single containers, you can generally replace the word "pod" with "container" and accurately understand the concept.





- What is Kubelet Kubernetes?
The kubelet is responsible for maintaining a set of pods, which are composed of one or more containers, on a local system. Within a Kubernetes cluster, the kubelet functions as a local agent that watches for pod specs via the Kubernetes API server





- What is a node in Kubernetes?
A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, previously known as a minion . A node may be a VM or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node has the services necessary to run pods and is managed by the master components. The services on a node include Docker, kubelet and kube-proxy





- What is a container in Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery




- What is a cluster of containers?
In Kubernetes Engine, a container cluster consists of at least one cluster master and multiple worker machines called nodes. ... A container cluster is the foundation of Kubernetes Engine: the Kubernetes objects that represent your containerized applications all run on top of a cluster.
